# CoolProp Web

This is a tool for students in [Universidad de Sevilla](http://www.us.es) that uses the [CoolProp library](http://www.coolprop.org/) to calculate the properties of some refrigerants.


Usage is pretty straightforward, select fluid on first dropdown, input two properties and their values and hit "Calcular". The rest of the properties will show in "Resultados".
